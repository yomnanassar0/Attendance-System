# Summary
This proposal will discuss the problem of recording the attendance of workers in big companies or factories or even students in universities, and how we are aiming to ease that process using AI-based attendance system. This will help make the process of recording attendance easier, feasible and efficient.
# Introduction
One of the basic things that are needed in any big organization is to record its employees’ attendance. To achieve that, face recognition can be used in the digital era to record the attendance of anyone present in an organization with the current date and time. Using a camera, the system will detect the person’s face and record his/her arrival and departure with a time stamp for both entries.
# Needs/Problems
The frequent way used to record attendance is the manual way which has a number of drawbacks, including: manual time entry which takes a long time, the paper work, in addition to the probability of any human error. For these reasons, the AI attendance system will be more efficient money and time-wise. It is easy to use and user friendly.
#Goals/Objectives
* Punctual and accurate face detection
* Improve efficiency 
* Payroll and attendance management 
* Less resources and time consumption
# Functional Requirements
* The system uses a camera to scan the person’s face
* The system detects whether the person is in the database or not
* The system recognizes the person’s face
* The system records the time of the person’s arrival and departure time
# Non-Functional Requirements
Accuracy and Precision: The system should be able to recognize the user in accuracy and precision.
* Security: The system should secure the users’ data and images.
* Usability: The system should be user-friendly, simple and easy to use.
* Responsiveness: The System should execute in high speed.
* The system will be build using Python, Tensorflow and OpenCv
